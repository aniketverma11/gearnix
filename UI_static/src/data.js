        description: "In Dubai, UAE, Gearnix Trading is the best Cat6 Cable Dealer. A 4 twisted pair sheathed copper wire cable called category 6—also referred to as a network, LAN, or Ethernet Data Cable—can sustain data transfer rates of up to 1 gigabit per second (1,000 megabits). Large files can be transferred quickly across an office network because of this increased bandwidth. A Cat6 cable is typically used to link a computer to a hub, router, or switch so that files can be shared across a network or to access the Internet.\n\nTwisted pair cable is the industry standard for Cat6 cable, which helps to decrease crosstalk and lower noise from electrical interference. Shielded twisted pair (STP) and unshielded twisted pair are the two varieties of twisted pair cable that are available (UTP). Cat6 cable, PVC cable, LSZH cables, outdoor cables, FTP cables, STP cables, SFTP cables, and other types of networking cables are available. We also have Belden and Paige brand audio, communication, speaker, and other cables. We offer network cables that are STC approved, UV listed, and TRA approved in both our premium and budget-friendly brands."
